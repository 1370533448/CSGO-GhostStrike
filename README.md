# GhostStrike
Simple concept for a custom [CS:GO](http://store.steampowered.com/app/730/?l=german) gamemode that turned out to be pretty fun!

It is tested, and meant to be played 5v5, so a normal "competitive" base.

When the round starts Terrorists are unable to see, or hear Counterterrorists. On the other hand, Counterterrorists are unable to attack in any way. 40 seconds after the round has started a random Terrorist will be given a bomb, which he then can proceed to plant anywhere on the map. As soon as the bomb is planted Counterterrorists become visible to the Terrorists, and are able to Attack. After that its normal Counter-Strike with the aim to defuse the bomb.

#####Restrictions (Per concept):

- you are not (supposed to be) able to plant the bomb in locations where you are required to get boosted into. This is achieved by making collisions bouncy.
- While the steps of invisible Counterterrorists are inaudible, any other sound like jumping is not (Cvar changeable).
- Invisible Counterterrorists can still be hit by the Terrorists. This just adds more fun and thrill to the whole thing because it becomes a spamfest and you have to avoid getting killed before Terrorits plant the bomb (Cvar changeable).
- Terrorists are able to bounce into the invisible Counterterrorists, and see blood decals caused by damaging them. Again, this adds more fun and thrill to the game.

#####Restrictions (Other):

- When disabling the plugin you have to reload the map because any available bombzones get removed, and a new global one is spawned.
